# Redux quiz group project

This was a group project to build a quiz using Redux and React.

## The problem

We planned initially using Mural and discussed our quiz design, how the quiz might be broken down into different components, and what the content would be. We then began by getting the questions and answers to be displayed using the useSelector hook. Once we had this we added the functionality for changing the state by dispatching actions to Redux. UseSelector was used to display the results from the quiz in the summary page, and once we had the main functionalitites of the quiz in place we added questions and styled using styled components.

Developers of the quiz:
Sarah Mottram
Lovisa Carling
Johanna Mannestål
Jakob Lindström
Haru Ahn
Maria Bergman
